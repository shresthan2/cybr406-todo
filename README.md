# TODO App

In this exercise you will create an application that stores a list of TODO items.

## Instructions

To complete this project, you will need to get all the unit tests to complete successfully. The tests are located under
**src/test/java.**

Run the tests by right clicking `TodoApplicationTests` and selecting `Run` or `Debug`.

Complete the tests in the order they appear in TodoApplicationsTests.java, starting from the top of the file and working
your way down. IntelliJ does not necessarily display the tests in the order they appear in the code, so be sure to
open the file and read it!
